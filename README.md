📊 Customer Churn Prediction
Predicting customer churn is critical for businesses aiming to retain clients and optimize engagement strategies. This project leverages machine learning to identify patterns in customer behavior and forecast churn risk, enabling proactive decision-making.

🚀 Project Overview
This notebook demonstrates a full pipeline for churn prediction using structured customer data. It includes:

Data preprocessing and feature engineering

Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Model training and evaluation (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)

Performance metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, ROC-AUC)

Strategic insights for business retention

🧠 Technologies Used
Python: pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, XGBoost

Jupyter Notebook: for interactive development and visualization

Machine Learning: classification models with hyperparameter tuning

Compliance Framing: ethical data handling aligned with POPIA/GDPR principles

📈 Key Insights
High churn risk correlates with low tenure, high monthly charges, and lack of contract commitment.

XGBoost outperformed baseline models with superior ROC-AUC and recall—ideal for minimizing false negatives.

Feature importance analysis supports targeted retention strategies.
